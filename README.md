## 🎯 Objective:
To understand VPN setup and usage, test its effectiveness, and observe its impact on IP address and internet performance.

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- VPN Used: **Browsec VPN (Free version)**
- Browser: Google Chrome
- Websites Tested:
  - [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)
  - [https://1337x.to](https://1337x.to)

## 🧾 Steps Followed:

### 🔹 Step 1: Connected to the Internet (without VPN)
- Checked actual IP, location, and ISP using [whatismyipaddress.com].
- Visited restricted site: **1337x.to** (not accessible normally).
- Ran internet speed test:
  - **Download speed**: 15.7 Mbps
  - **Upload speed**: 8.30 Mbps

### 🔹 Step 2: Connected to VPN using Browsec (Location: Amsterdam)
- New IP assigned: *51.159.226.160 (Amsterdam, Netherlands)*
- Rechecked IP location on [whatismyipaddress.com]
- Accessed **1337x.to** successfully with full content.
- Re-ran internet speed test:
  - **Download speed**: 0.84 Mbps
  - **Upload speed**: 6.62 Mbps

📸 Screenshots:

## 🔐 VPN Benefits:
- Hides your real IP and location.
- Encrypts traffic and bypasses ISP/government restrictions.
- Helps access geo-blocked or censored content.
- Prevents tracking by websites or third parties.

## ⚠️ VPN Limitations:
- Slower internet speeds (especially with free VPNs).
- Not 100% anonymous (VPN provider can log traffic).
- Some websites may block VPN IPs.
- Free VPNs may have data limits or server restrictions.

## 📚 Learning Outcome:
- Understood how VPNs work practically.
- Tested VPN effectiveness for changing IP and bypassing restrictions.
- Observed real impact on browsing performance.
